# Está Noite Revelarei os Teus Segredos (Legacy)
Está Noite Revelarei os Teus Segredos is a legacy project created by the former members of the extinguished Hiscom Studios. This was created while we were game design students of Universidade Anhembi Morumbi as part of our 6th semester evalutation.

<h2> Goals </h2>
<p>
  The main goal of this project was to created a 3d game based on one of many movies that were provided to us. We chose a barazilian movie called ¨À Meia-Noite Levarei sua Alma¨, which is a movie from a very famous horror brazilian director-character which is Zé do Caixão. The idea was that the game should not depend on the movie to be understandable, but should complete it at the same time.

<h2> Achieved </h2>
<p>
  In order to do what we proposed, we created like a sequel to the movie with a completly new story, so the player does not depend on knowing the characters or what already in the past to fully understand the games story, by creating a 3d semi-cartoonized horror trash game.
